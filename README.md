# Amazon Clone in React, Tailwind CSS & Redux

"This project is a React.js-based clone of Amazon that I developed a long time ago. I recently revisited it and decided to share it with you on GitHub. It’s one of my earlier attempts at building an e-commerce platform, While it’s not a complete replica, it reflects my understanding of React and component-based architecture at the time and it showcases my understanding of React and front-end development during that time. Feel free to explore, give feedback, or contribute!"

"Check it out and let me know what you think!"
